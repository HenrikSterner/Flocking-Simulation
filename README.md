# Flocking-Simulation
This Simulation is based upon Craig Reynolds "Boid" algorithm which simulates the flocking behavoiur of birds. Individual boid objects follow four simple steering rules:

1. Alignment: head towards average direction of nearby boids.
2. Cohesion: steer towards the average location of nearby boids.
3. Separation: Avoid Colision with nearby boids.
4. Flee: Run away from predators.

# Feautures:
1. Two different types of Boids.
2. Predator avoidance.
3. Peripheral Vision.
4. Quadtree Optimized
